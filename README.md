                           DT7-QR Rewards System:
       A Decentralized Incentive Layer for Bitcoin Engagement and Transactions

                                  Abstract
   The DT7-QR Rewards System is a decentralized framework designed to enhance Bitcoin’s 
   utility as a transactional currency and community-driven ecosystem. By integrating QR 
   code-based engagement, tiered staking, and governance, it incentivizes active 
   participation and peer-to-peer transactions while navigating regulatory realities. Built 
   for scalability and for payouts, the system distributes BTC rewards from a community 
   treasury, empowering people to move beyond institutional tools and assert control 
   over their financial interactions.

                       1. Vision: Bitcoin as a Living Currency
   Bitcoin was created as a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency, yet its adoption is 
   increasingly shaped by institutions and regulatory oversight. 
   
   DT7-QR Rewards System aims to-
   
   Drive Engagement: Encourage active participation through QR code scans embedded in 
   livestream platforms.
   
   Promote Transactions:
     Distribute BTC rewards via Lightning Network (LN) to facilitate real-world use.
     
   Empower Communities:
     Enable peer-driven governance to counter centralized control.
     
   Ensure Compliance: 
     Balance regulatory requirements with peer privacy and decentralization.
     
   This system positions Bitcoin as a vibrant, transactional currency, not merely an 
   investment vehicle.

                       2. Core Mechanism: QR-Based Incentives
   The system incentivizes engagement and transacting by rewarding peers for scanning QR 
   codes integrated into a livestream. 
   
   Key components include:    
   QR Scans: QR codes earn ERC-20/testnet (a low-value unit for tracking participation)
   
   Reward Allocation: 30% of the daily treasury is distributed as BTC/LN rewards to 
   eligible wallets based on proportion of ERC-20/testnet scanned.

   New Peer's Incentive: New participants (<1 week, no staking history) completing 
   consecutive scans receive a one-time random ERC-20/testnet bonus to encourage onboarding.
   
   Eligibility: Wallets must complete at least 2 scans/day to qualify for QR rewards, 
   ensuring active engagement.
   
   Rewards are distributed via BTC/LN to reinforce Bitcoin’s transactional utility.

                       3. Treasury and Fund Allocation
   The treasury, held in BTC within a multisig wallet, is funded by community-driven 
   sources. 
   
   Funds are allocated as follows:
   
   80% Traders:    
    60% for games and social interactions /livestreams    
    30% for QR scan rewards, distributed as BTC/LN   
    10% for staking rewards.   
      
   20% Savings:   
    6% operational   
    7% yield generation   
    7% cold storage, reserved for high-tier rewards / DAO community.
          
   This allocation balances immediate rewards with sustainable growth, encouraging 
   Bitcoin’s use in everyday transactions.

                          4. Staking Rewards
   A separate staking system incentivizes long-term participation:
   
   Tiered Structure: Higher tiers require more ERC-20/testnet staked over longer periods, 
   offering increasing weekly BTC/LN rewards.
   
   No QR Dependency: Staking rewards are independent of QR scans, ensuring accessibility 
   for passive peers.
   
   Governance Eligibility: Staked wallets retain voting power, even if below minimums, 
   promoting inclusivity.
   
   Staking rewards in BTC/LN, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as a transactional currency.

                     5. Anti-Gaming and Privacy Measures
   The system ensures fairness and privacy while combating abuse:   
   
   Time-Bound Nonces: QR codes include unique identifiers, generated and verified.  
   
   Scan Limits: Automated checks and caps.   
   
   Privacy-Preserving Logging: Wallet IDs are hashed and verified
   
   Manual Oversight: Reward distribution includes checks   
   
   These measures maintain integrity while protecting user privacy in a regulatory-conscious 
   environment.

                        6. Governance: Community Control
   The system empowers peers through decentralized governance:
   
   Voting Power: Determined by staking duration and ERC-20/testnet scanned, with weights favoring 
   stakers with a vote cap to prevent corruption.
   
   Initial Framework: Early stakers define guidelines transitioning to a DAO.
   Transparency: Decisions are logged for auditability.
   
   Adaptability: The DAO can adjust minimums, caps, and weights to reflect community needs 
   and regulatory changes.
   
   This model ensures peers, not institutions, shape the system’s future.

                         7. Regulatory Compliance
   The system is designed to navigate global regulatory landscapes:
      
   U.S. peers: Rewards are distributed via non-custodial LN wallets with minimal logs to 
   comply with IRS/SEC rules.
      
   Non-U.S. peers: Direct BTC/LN payouts
      
   No Stablecoins: Avoiding securities exposure, with ERC-20/testnet low value serving as a 
   compliance buffer.
   
   Manual Distribution: Human oversight of payouts
      
   By leveraging Bitcoin’s infrastructure, the system supports compliance without 
   sacrificing decentralization.

                        8. Technical Implementation
   The system combines off-chain and on-chain components for efficiency:
   
   Off-Chain: hashed wallet IDs, timestamps, ERC-20/testnet totals
   
   On-Chain: A dApp enforces limits, nonces, and tracks staking/governance data
   Reward Distribution: Manual BTC/LN payouts
   
   Setup Efficiency: Core components (hashing, nonces, limits) leverage trusted tools for 
   rapid deployment.
   
   This hybrid approach balances scalability, cost, and decentralization.

                        9. Enhancing Bitcoin’s Role
   The DT7-QR Rewards System strengthens Bitcoin’s utility by:
   
   Encouraging Transactions: BTC/LN rewards incentivize real-world use
   
   Fostering Engagement: QR-based participation drives community interaction
   
   Empowering Users: Governance ensures community control
   
   Navigating Regulation: Privacy-preserving and compliance-focused design prepares for 
   global oversight.
   
   The system positions Bitcoin as a dynamic currency for peer-to-peer transactions and 
   community ecosystems.

                            10. Conclusion
   The DT7-QR Rewards System is a decentralized incentive layer that enhances Bitcoin’s role 
   as a transactional currency and community-driven network. By rewarding engagement, 
   facilitating BTC/LN transactions, and empowering peers through governance, it counters 
   the institutionalization of Bitcoin while addressing regulatory challenges. This 
   framework invites peers to reclaim Bitcoin’s original promise: a currency by and for the 
   pepo.
